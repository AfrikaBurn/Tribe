description: "<p>It is your responsibility to clean up your performance site and ensure that no trace associated with your performance remains anywhere. Nothing. Nada. Zilch. Zip. Zero. Fokol.</p>\r\n<p>D-E-A-R is our newest department that deals with Leave No Trace and Matter Out of Place (MOOP).<br>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.afrikaburn.com/community/d-e-a-r\" target=\"_blank\">Please read up more on D-E-A-R and MOOP here</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Performance famously attract other people's MOOP (matter out of place). So you may very well have more than your own waste to deal with - especially if you're creating a party space. Bring extra trash bags (Preferably stronger bags than the usual plastic oneâ€™s) and make sure you have space to transport trash back to town. </p>"
