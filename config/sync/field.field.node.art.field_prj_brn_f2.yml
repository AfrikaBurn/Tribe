If this is what you've got planned,&nbsp;you'll need&nbsp;to motivate to burn your piece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember: you don't have to burn your piece. You might think that burning's an easy way to get rid of it (and not transport it back), but it's not: you'd still need&nbsp;to clean up the burn site &amp;&nbsp;remove all the&nbsp;coals, rebar etc.<br />\r\nSo consider carefully whether burning is important to the meaning of your piece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We love works that can go on to live&nbsp;beyond the event, whether as ‘permanent’ installations in an urban space or at Decompression, Streetopia, Maker Faire etc. So&nbsp;consider designing your project in&nbsp;a way that it can be dismantled &amp;&nbsp;repurposed. You can donate your good materials to Outreach projects&nbsp;(arrange this&nbsp;in advance before the event).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it's really important for your piece&nbsp;to burn, plan for&nbsp;that by bearing in mind that you're building a fire, and that has to be considered in your design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our Art Committee and&nbsp;Pyro Team will assess your request to burn your piece based on your motivation and design.</p>\r\n"
