    value: "<p><strong>Planning to&nbsp;burn your piece?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here's how it works: your piece&nbsp;doesn't have to be approved -&nbsp;but your burn does. If this is what you've got planned,&nbsp;you'll need&nbsp;to motivate to burn your piece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember: you don't have to burn your piece. You might think that burning's an easy way to get rid of it (and not transport it back), but it's not: you'd still need&nbsp;to clean up the burn site &amp;&nbsp;remove all the&nbsp;coals, rebar etc.<br />\r\nSo consider carefully whether burning is important to the meaning of your piece.<br />\r\nWe love works that can go on to live&nbsp;beyond the event, whether as ‘permanent’ installations in an urban space or at other events such as Decompression, Streetopia, Maker Faire etc.&nbsp;<br />\r\nYou can also &nbsp;donate your good materials to Outreach projects&nbsp;(arrange this&nbsp;in advance before the event).<br />\r\nSo consider designing your project in&nbsp;a way that it can be dismantled &amp;&nbsp;repurposed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it's really important for your piece&nbsp;to burn, plan for&nbsp;that, by bearing in mind that you're building a fire, and that has to be considered in your design from the start.<br />\r\nThe Art Committee and Pyro Team will assess your request to burn, based on your motivation and design, as we'll be in contact with you about it.<br />\r\n(The deadline to request burning your artwork will be in February, the exact date will be announced.)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.afrikaburn.com/the-event/artworks/artworks/building-art-burn\" target=\"_blank\">Please read more about burning artworks</a>.</p>\r\n"
