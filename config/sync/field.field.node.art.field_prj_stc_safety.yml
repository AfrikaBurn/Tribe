description: 'Your artwork needs to withstand extreme weather, including high winds. Make sure it''s securely anchored, that itâ€™s not going to fall over, and nothing will fall off. Describe how you intend to anchor it: what will you use to mark guy ropes and cover rebar? For large-scale installations, we''ll need to have your piece signed off by an engineer. It is  your responsibility to maintain and monitor this safety throughout the event.'
